An iOS app that lets you create scheduled tasks with a priority.

## Description
Tasky is an iOS app to assist you in your day-to-day life.

You can create tasks with a deadline, or set them to repeat everyday. You can specify a category to group the tasks,
and set a priority (low, medium, high).

The app will send you a notification, if you opt for it.

The app is developed using SwiftUI framework.
